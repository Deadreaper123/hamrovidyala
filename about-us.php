    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="fade-in">Welcome to "Hamro Vidyalaya", a project based on the School Management System (SMS). In today's education system, the quality of education plays a crucial role in the country's development. Many educational organizations are striving to improve their systems, and effective management of school resources using current technology is a key aspect of this improvement.
      Our project aims to facilitate continuous communication between the principal, teachers, parents, and students. To achieve this, we have developed a website that caters to the needs of all users. For students, the website allows them to view their grades, communicate with the principal and teachers for complaints, recommendations, or absence permissions, and stay updated with school news and posts from other users.
      For administrators and principals, the system provides full control, enabling them to add new parents, teachers, and students along with their respective subjects. Teachers can input and edit grades for their subjects and have direct communication with students and parents. Parents have access to their children's grades without the ability to edit them and can directly communicate with teachers and the principal. All users can share educational updates and posts, which are visible to everyone using the system.</p>
